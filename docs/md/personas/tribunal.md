| Biography   | There always comes a time when Javier has to dedicate more time to his work, reading all the dissertations that have been assigned to him. He is always curious about them, as it is not unusual to find something new to learn something new, discover new points of view or methodologies, although the workload makes it cost him an extra effort to make these revisions. |
| Fears       | What Javier is most afraid of finding is a disorganized documentation, with a poor level of expression or full of unnecessary or irrelevant information, without reliable sources well indicated, since it will be a more difficult project to study and with less value.                                                                                                     |
| Necessities | He wants organized and clear documentation that demonstrates good analysis for the problem to be solved and proposes valuable and justified solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
