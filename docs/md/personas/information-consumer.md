| Biography   | Julio recently started working in his new position. He has been tasked with finding information about the current book market, to find out which genres and authors have the most potential to reach a higher level of sales. He works with many types of tools to get the information to analyze, and likes to keep up to date with news of new publishings.                           |
| Fears       | Julio's main concern is to make an investment to obtain low quality information, as this increases his workload by adding data preprocessing requirements and, on top of that, reduces the reliability of the data, which can lead him to make bad decisions that affect his work. He does not want processed data either, as the processing techniques will be unknown and unreliable. |
| Necessities | He wants to find a good source of data on the most popular books today, to find out which authors and genres have the biggest market and therefore the best chances of good sales.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
