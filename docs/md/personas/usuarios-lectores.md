| Biography   | After finishing his studies, Sergio finds more time for reading. He enjoys reading fantasy and science fiction novels as much as history books. He is good with the computer, although he is only an expert in communication and design tools, and does not usually use other types of applications. He likes to keep a list of short, medium and long term goals as it helps him to lead a better quality of life. |
| Fears       | His main concern is that the history books given to him by his grandfather will not appear anywhere. On the other hand, his main concern is that the library he created will not allow him to differentiate his history readings from novels, as he considers it two different types of hobbies.                                                                                                                    |
| Necessities | He wants a tool that manages his readings, allowing him to differentiate between completed, in progress and pending in order to support his list of objectives. As he is very organized, he would like the tool to be easy to manage and versatile in case he wants to change how it is organized.                                                                                                                  |

| Biography   | Since she was a teenager Ana has enjoyed reading a lot, becoming fond of many different genres. In fact at home she has a bookshelf full of books, which she organizes in different ways all the time, even by the color of the cover. Lately she has found it difficult to find a new book to read, and has realized that she has reread quite a few books, so she wants to explore new books, even those not available in her language.                   |
| Fears       | Ana is concerned that _My Many Reads_ will not offer good tools for discovering new books. She feels that the only way to get recommendations from a system of this nature is from a library, and that the platform will therefore not offer her options that are very different from other tools of its kind. She also wants to explore books freely based on his own criteria, and is concerned that she will not have much freedom in doing this search. |
| Necessities | Her main need is to find new reading. She does not want to rely only on recommendations based on her library, and would like to have tools to manually browse books based on specific search criteria. She would also like to find recommendations based on a specific book, and if they are justified by other users, so much the better.                                                                                                                  |
